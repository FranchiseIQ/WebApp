# Processed Brands Tracking File
# Format: TICKER|BrandName|Category|CompletedDate|LocationsGenerated
#
# This file tracks all brands that have been successfully processed
# through the FranchiseMap data generation pipeline
#
# NOTE: This file was reset to allow re-processing of all brands
# with the new fallback synthetic data generation feature.
# Fixes: GitHub Actions workflow now generates synthetic location data
# when OpenStreetMap API is unavailable due to network/proxy issues.
#
# Date Range: 2025-12-21 onwards
# Total Processed: 0 (awaiting regeneration)
# Last Update: 2025-12-21T18:00:00Z

# PROCESSED BATCHES
# [Awaiting first workflow trigger with new fallback logic]
